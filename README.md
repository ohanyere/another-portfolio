# 🚀 Developer Portfolio — React + TypeScript

A modern, animated, and highly interactive developer portfolio built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Framer Motion**.  
This project showcases my experience as a **frontend engineer**, including component architecture, UI animations, reusable design patterns, and testing best practices.
